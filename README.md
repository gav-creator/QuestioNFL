Questions about player status? We have answers.

Our mission is to provide users with a reliable source on whether a player is looking good to <strong>play</strong> this upcoming week. We have top of the line <strong>statisticians and coders </strong>to get you the right info to win your next fantasy football game!

Our frontend was set up with a CSS and HTML, and backend was set up with python. We used flask as an API to communicate between the two.
