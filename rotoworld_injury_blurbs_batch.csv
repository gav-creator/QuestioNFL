While Irsay’s comments suggest Taylor is trending in the right direction heading into camp, we’d obviously like a more concrete stance on a player of his caliber. Still, we’d expect him to be ready for camp and Week 1, barring any setbacks. Taylor should be a high-end RB1 across all formats, especially on a Colts offense that’s expected to be run heavy this season."

On Sunday, it was reported Charbonnet would be sidelined indefinitely with a shoulder injury, so his return to the field on Thursday is a bit of a surprise. He later participated in 11-on-11 drills, which is enough to suggest he’s good to go at this point."

The rookie started over third-year TE Brock Wright, who had a 10-yard catch on two targets. With Detroit losing TE Shane Zylstra to a season-ending injury earlier this week, LaPorta only needs to hold off Wright to open the season as the Lions’ TE1."

He eventually limped off the field before getting checked out by trainers. Adams eventually left the joint practice. The injury could be nothing, but it’s worth monitoring given Adams’ importance to the Raiders and the fantasy landscape. Should the issues cause him to miss time, Hunter Renfrow and Jakobi Meyers would be in line for notable bumps in target share, though the Raiders’ offense would likely crater without its top receiver."

The Colts felt good enough about Moss’ injury to move on from RB Kenyan Drake at final cuts. Deon Jackson is expected to start in Week 1 and should split the backfield with Moss until Jonathan Taylor (PUP) returns."

With Williams targeting a Week 1 return, Brown’s chances at the RB2 role took a hit, but the rookie should see time with Evans in a passing role. Brown led the Bengals RBs with six catches for 32 yards this preseason."

Jefferson last season served as the team’s nominal No. 1 wideout after Kupp went down with a season-ending ankle injury, posting a 24/369/3 line over 11 games. He could be playable in 12-team formats in Week 1 against the Seahawks if Kupp is sidelined with a muscle strain he sustained on Thursday. Puka Nacua and TuTu Atwell, according to Rodrigue, would function as the Rams’ second and third receivers if Kupp is out."

He was able to log a limited practice on Friday, so the hope is he’ll be able to go in Week 4 against the 49ers. Brown has 14 receptions for 143 yards and two touchdowns through the first three weeks of the season, and is averaging just over seven targets per game. He’d be a fringe WR3 against a stout 49ers defense."

Although the fourth contest in a grueling season can hardly be considered a must-win game, the Chargers find themselves slipping in the competitive AFC West and need a victory to keep pace with the Chiefs."
20231007142013,http://web.archive.org/web/20231007142013/https://www.nbcsports.com/fantasy/football/player-news,"Williams was listed with both a quad and hip injury this week. “I feel pretty good but I didn’t practice the whole week,’' said Williams, who sat out Wednesday’s practice and was listed as limited on Thursday and full on Friday. “I’m going to do what they say.” The Broncos met Friday night to decide whether Williams will play. Hip flexors come with week-to-week timetables, but as the Bengals seen with WR Ja’Marr Chase last year, they can lead to more serious injuries. The Broncos play on Thursday night in Week 6, which could factor into what they do with Williams. Holding out Williams would give the Broncos a chance to see what rookie Jaleel McLaughlin can do with a full workload vs the Jets."

In his first two games as a Bengal, he ran a route on 75 percent of the team’s dropbacks and was targeted nine times.

This is the first week since suffering the injury that Adams has played in the first practice of the week instead of not participating, indicating that the shoulder is getting healthier. Whether he’s catching passes from Jimmy Garoppolo (back injury) or one of the Raiders’ back-ups, Adams is a top receiver play for fantasy."

It looks like that did the trick as a full practice is a good sign he will suit up on Sunday. Freiermuth wasn’t doing much before going down with the injury. He had five catches for 46 yards and two touchdowns in three weeks before going down with the injury. He will rank as a TE2 for Week 7.

A full practice on Wednesday points toward Pittsburgh activating him from injured reserve ahead of their Week 7 matchup with the Rams.

Chase is reportedly a game-time decision and will test out his back in pre-game warmups. Only Trenton Irwin and Andre Iosivas remained as healthy wide receivers behind slot man Tyler Boyd until the elevations. Fantasy managers will want to keep a close eye on the status of Chase 90-minutes prior to the team’s early afternoon kickoff.

He has been out since Week 4 with a hamstring injury, grabbing eight receptions in four games played. Freiermuth has been listed as questionable on the Steelers’ final Week 11 injury report. His return will make Connor Heyward fantasy irrelevant, though Freiermuth himself is barely a TE2 with Kenny Pickett at quarterback."

The Chiefs’ RB2 hasn’t enjoyed the same role he did last season when he unexpectedly emerged as a fantasy league-winner while totaling 56 receptions for 512 yards and nine touchdowns. Instead, McKinnon has watched Isiah Pacheco seize control of the Chiefs’ backfield while limiting McKinnon to 32 touches and 185 yards over 10 games. McKinnon would carry some value if Pacheco were to miss time, but can be kept off the fantasy radar for now."

In his absence, Isiah Pacheco logged five receptions in addition to 15 carries. With McKinnon back, Pacheco should return to his two-down role, keeping him in the middle of the RB2 range.

Goedert’s injury came just before the Eagles’ bye, as he’s missed only two games thus far. He underwent surgery shortly after his injury but appears to have a chance to suit up on Sunday against the 49ers. We’ll see what kind of game-day status he carries heading into the weekend, but Philly’s TE1 appears to be set for a return sooner rather than later."

The veteran receiver hasn’t logged a practice all week, but head coach Jonathan Gannon said on Friday that brown was “trending toward playing” when asked about Brown’s availability. Brown played through same same heel injury in last week’s loss to the Rams, so it’s possible his absence this week is out of precaution to ensure he’s ready for Sunday. He’ll likely draw a questionable tag heading into the weekend, making his status one to watch when the team announces their Week 13 inactives."

His light workload was likely maintenance. Don’t be surprised to see the veteran’s reps limited in practice for the remainder of the year.

Watson missed the first three games of the season with a hamstring injury and was finally starting to come into his own for the Packers this year. It is unclear how long his most recent soft tissue injury will keep him out of the lineup, which is particularly concerning for the organization now that they have played themselves into playoff contention during the second half of the season. The result of the team’s Week 14 game against the Giants is likely to play a role in how cautious they can be with their second-year wide receiver."

The Browns acquired Jeudy from the Broncos earlier this offseason in exchange for 2024 fifth and sixth-round picks and signed him to a three-year, $58 million extension a week later. He’s expected to operate as the Browns’ primary slot receiver this season and could have some high-end WR3 value in PPR leagues if the target volume is there."

He suffered a torn ACL and MCL in that Week 16 contest against the Lions, which usually takes six to nine months to fully return from. In some cases, it can take longer.

It’s possible he’ll play in Week 2 against the Titans, but if not, Davis Allen would appear next in line to play in 2TE sets."

Jones signed a two-year, $7 million contract with the 49ers this offseason and was the rumored target of head coach Kyle Shanahan during the 2021 NFL Draft when the Niners used the No. 3 overall pick to select Trey Lance. Viewed as an ideal fit in Shanahan’s system, Jones completed 17-of-23 passes for 209 yards and two interceptions this preseason, and will have his work cut out for him with George Kittle (hamstring) on injured reserve and Jauan Jennings (shoulder) at risk of also missing Week 2. Jones shouldn’t be viewed as anything more than a low-end QB2/high-end QB3 in his Niners debut and can be avoided altogether outside of 2QB and superflex leagues."
